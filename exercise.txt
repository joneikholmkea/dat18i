Exercise 1: 
a) Send a “Hi There!” from one Java program to another, using Java Socket (on the same computer).
b) Now send this greeting to a friend’s computer

Exercise 2: Make a Client/Server program, similar to Ex. 1, but with these extra features:
a) at the client program, the console should ask the user for a message to send.
b) after typing is done, the user should press RETURN. 
c) then the Client program should send this message to the Server 
d) the Server should print that message.

Exercise 3:  Improve the program from Ex. 2 with these features: 
a) the client console should keep asking for more messages to send to the Server 
b) for each message, the Server should print it. 
c) keep doing this, until the user types “quit”

Exercise 4: Improve the program from Ex. 3 with these feature: 
a) Enable the Server to hold simultaneous connections to multiple Clients.

Exercise 5: Improve the program from Ex. 4 with these features: 
a) Broadcast an incoming client message to ALL connected Clients 
b) If a user types “quit” into the Client console, the Server should terminate that client’s connection. 

Exercise 6: Improve the program from Ex. 5 with these features: 
a) Let each Client have a username, such that messages will be of the form:
some-name: “Hello There !”
some-other-name: “How are you doing?”
etc.
